Death Ops Core Mod

This contains the full modpack for Death Ops Core, a mod for Project Zomboid.  The mod will achieve the following goals:

1.  Create a professin called Death Ops Operative.
2.  Create traits (squad-based roles) that grant XP boosts.
3.  Create hard-starting levels for the character(s) inside a SP/MP game across the board.  No one role boosts, increases, or decreases the hard-set level.  The hard-set levels are even across all roles.
4.  Create a trait selector system in which players may choose a role-based trait.  By doing so,  the other traits are greyed out.
5.  Weapon loadouts will become paramount to expanding this mod.  Standardized kits will be uniform across all Death Operative roles; all roles will be expanded with unique tools, weaponry, and other learned recipes to better suit cooperative teamplay.
6.  Brita Weapons Pack, Firearms Expanded B41 will be incorporated into this mod and will be called by function through weapon loadouts.  Starting characters will have the correct weaponry, equipment, armor, and other miscellany when starting a new SP/MP session.
7.  Other ideas to expand this mod will be taken into consideration.
